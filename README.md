# Movie_Recommender_System

For this project I will be focusing on Content Based Recommendation System, as I think using metadata like ‘genres’, ‘actor’ , ‘overview/plot’ can provide us a good deal of insight on understanding users preferences and help recommend movies or TV shows according to this. It helps get a good gauge of users likes/dislikes.
