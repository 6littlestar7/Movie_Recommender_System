# Movie_Recommender_System

For this project I will be focusing on Content Based Recommendation System, as I think using metadata like ‘genres’, ‘actor’ , ‘overview/plot’ can provide us a good deal of insight on understanding users preferences and help recommend movies or TV shows according to this. It helps get a good gauge of users likes/dislikes.
I will be using the TMDB-500 dataset for this project simply because it provides me with many columns to work with which have very useful information like the plot of movie, details about the cast, crew, directors, duration of the film,run time etc. This will help me get insights for my data analysis.
